Struggling with workflow here.

Are "container repos" good or not? 

If so, should we make things inside them clones, modules, or pardirs

Gitroot can be cleaned out, and we can easily figure out what sorts of things we need for which current sets of tasks (a student, a course, a workshop, an themed research project (!).
